!!! question "What is <span class="notranslate">akshara</span>?"
    akshara is a tool for turning a config file (`system.yaml`) into a fully built system. It does this by parsing the config file and performing actions against an Arch rootfs tarball to create a new system, which [replaces your old one](../nerdy-stuff/atomicity.md) after a reboot (user folders, containers and Flatpaks are preserved).
