# :material-wifi-off: Offline Reading

!!! warning "You will need to update your offline copy manually."
    The version (hash) of your copy is shown in a bar at the top of the page:

    ![offline-banner](assets/img/offline-banner.png){ width=500px }

    Compare this hash to the latest commit hash (on the right) in the [commit list](https://git.blendos.co/asterisk/blend-docs-material/-/commits/main){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } to see if your version is up to date.

You can download our docs for offline reading using the button below.

Open **artifacts.zip** and extract the `site` folder. Open `index.html` in your browser. Even the search bar will work offline!
