# :material-truck-cargo-container: Container Management

in blendOS, you manage containers from the **System** app (also known as **blendOS Settings**).

When you first open it, (:material-apps-box: > System) you will see a window like this:

In the first tab (`Linux Containers`) you can create assosciations and Linux distro containers.
