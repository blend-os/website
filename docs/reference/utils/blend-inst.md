!!! question "What is <span class="notranslate">blend-inst</span>?"
    [`blend-inst`](https://github.com/blend-os/blend-inst){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } is a rewrite of [Jade](https://git.getcryst.al/crystal/software/jade){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } (from Crystal Linux) in Python. It has also been reworked to fit our new install style (only do partitioning and system install in the liveCD) and to use the filesystem of the liveCD, instead of painstakingly bootstrapping a fresh filesystem to the installed system.

    After the user sets up their install in Jade's GUI, Jade calls `blend-inst`, which does partitioning and installing, before rebooting and calling `blend-postinst`, which sets up a basic system with GNOME's welcome screen, where the user sets things like their timezone and makes an account.

## :octicons-terminal-16: CLI usage

!!! warning "blend-inst is not meant to be used this way!"
    The tool is meant to be called from a graphical or terminal UI, which creates the config and calls `blend-inst` to install it. For this purpose, we use [`jade-gui`](https://github.com/blend-os/jade-gui){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }.
