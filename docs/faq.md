# :material-chat-question: FAQ

## What desktops are officially supported?

- GNOME ({{ track("default-gnome") }} track)
- KDE Plasma ({{ track("plasma") }} track)
- XFCE ({{ track("xfce") }} track)
- Cinnamon ({{ track("cinnamon") }} track)
- MATE ({{ track("mate") }} track)
- LXQt ({{ track("lxqt") }} track)

You can [make your own tracks](reference/configs/system.md#tracks) to support whatever desktop or WM you want, this is just what we offer by default.

## The language I want isn't there!

Firstly, to change languages later on and check what's there, you can go to **Settings** > **System** (scroll down) > **Region and Language**.

To add a new language, edit `/etc/locale.gen` and add your locale. If you don't know what yours is, **we need to construct it first.**

Locales look like this:

```title="Structure"
<language>_<COUNTRY>.<ENCODING> <ENCODING>
```

i.e.

```title="Example: English (US)"
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
```

**You can find a list of [country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } and [language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes#Table){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } (look under set 1) on Wikipedia.** All language and country codes are 2 letters long. Your encoding will always be `UTF-8`.

To help you further, the example locale.gen file with all options is included below, just copy one ending with `UTF-8`.

Once you have your locale, add it in on a new line in `/etc/locale.gen`. If you don't know how to edit the file, open a terminal window and type `#!bash sudo nano /etc/locale.gen`.

![locale-nano](assets/img/locale-nano.png)
<small>Put the locale on a new line, right there.</small>

Go to the end with the arrow keys and hit  ++enter++ to make a new line. Paste your country code in with ++ctrl+shift+v++ or just type it. Hit ++ctrl+x++ to save.

Now, edit `/system.yaml` ([covered further down](#then-how-do-i-edit-systemyaml)) and add these lines:

```yaml title="system.yaml"
commands:
  - 'locale-gen'
```

!!! warning "Some languages need additional fonts!"
    **CJK**:
    ```yaml title="system.yaml"
    packages:
      - 'noto-fonts-cjk'
    ```

    **Arabic**:
    ```yaml title="system.yaml"
    packages:
      - 'noto-fonts'
    ```

    **Bengali & Indic**:
    ```yaml title="system.yaml"
    aur-packages:
      - 'ttf-freebanglafont'
    ```

    **Cyrillic** (i.e. Russian):
    ```yaml title="system.yaml"
    aur-packages:
      - 'ttf-paratype'
    ```

    **Hebrew**:
    ```yaml title="system.yaml"
    aur-packages:
      - 'opensiddur-hebrew-fonts'
    ```

    **Khmer**:
    ```yaml title="system.yaml"
    packages:
      - 'ttf-khmer'
    ```

    **Persian**:
    ```yaml title="system.yaml"
    aur-packages:
      - 'ttf-x2'
    ```

Save the file and [update your system](#what-is-updating), then reboot.

Now, set your language. In the default GNOME desktop, you need to go to **Settings** > **System** > **Region and Language**.

![region-gnome](assets/img/region-gnome.png)

Once there, click on **Language**.

![lang-gnome-1](assets/img/lang-gnome-1.png)

Now, click the :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis-vertical: icon to show all languages.

![lang-gnome-2](assets/img/lang-gnome-2.png)

??? failure "My language still isn't there!"
    If you've installed the needed fonts for your language and it still won't show up, validate that your `/etc/locale.gen` and `/system.yaml` files are correctly formatted. If they are properly formatted, manually find and install a font for your language, then reboot.

Find your newly added language and click it, then **Select**. It will now show a banner at the top of the settings window saying that you need to log out to apply language settings. Click the **Log Out** button to do so.


![lang-gnome-banner](assets/img/lang-gnome-banner.png)

Log back in, and revel in the fact that you can use your system in your own language.

!!! note "**System Settings** (not Settings) may still be in English."

## I want to change kernels!

blendOS ships with {{ archpkg("linux-zen") }} as it contains the required modules for Android support.

If you want to use another kernel, you will need to install the modules yourself.

Let's say I want to use {{ archpkg("linux-lts") }} for an older device.

!!! note "You need to [make your own track](reference/configs/system.md#tracks) to change kernels."

```yaml title="my-lts-track.yaml"
# Copy the base track but with linux-lts and linux-lts-headers innstead of linux-zen and linux-zen-headers
...
aur-packages:
  - 'binder_linux-dkms' # (1)!
```

1.  **Only add this line if you want Android support.**


```yaml title="system.yaml"
impl: "https://github.com/me/my-track-fork/raw/main"
track: "my-lts-track"
```

!!! info "The below steps are only applicable if you want Android support."

At this point, you've changed kernels. Now, create these new files to load the Waydroid modules:

```sh title="/etc/modules-load.d/binder_linux.conf"
# Load binder_linux at boot
binder_linux
```

```sh title="/etc/modprobe.d/binder_linux.conf"
# Options for binder_linux
options binder_linux devices=binder,hwbinder,vndbinder
```

Edit the GRUB configuration:

!!! bug "This is an extra step required to prevent [a segmentation fault](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=293566){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }."

```sh title="/etc/defaults/grub"
# find the below line and edit it to include ibt=off
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT} ibt=off"
```

## Why can't I use another init system?

blendOS relies heavily on [`systemd-nspawn`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-nspawn){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } for containers, which is like `chroot` but on steroids. It is included with the {{ archpkg('systemd') }} package on Arch.

## Why are my aliases not showing up on fish?

blendOS has a file in `/etc/profile.d` that tells POSIX-compliant shells (i.e. bash, zsh) where to find your container binaries. These shells source it by default and understand the format. Fish is not POSIX-compliant. All you have to do is add the following to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
if status is-login
    exec bash -c "test -e /etc/profile.d/blend.sh && source /etc/profile.d/blend.sh;\
    exec fish"
end
```

## The Plasma track isn't working!

On the boot menu, hit ++e++ on the `Arch Linux` option. This will open an editor with controls shown at the bottom (arrow keys to move).

Remove `splash` from the kernel parameters and hit ++ctrl+x++.

![grub-settings](assets/img/grub-settings.png)

This is only temporary, and will allow you to boot.

Once in your system, open the terminal. Type:

```
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

This will open a basic editor (arrow keys to move).

Remove `splash` from the second `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` near the end and hit ++ctrl+x++ to save and quit (hit ++y++ to save, ++enter++ to save as the same file name).

![splash-boot](assets/img/splash-boot.png)

Now type:

```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

The edit is now permanent and KDE Plasma should work.

## What should go on the host?

Things like:

- Drivers
- Game Launchers (as a flatpak or a host package)
- Terminal emulators
- Web Browsers
- File managers
- Desktops/WMs
- Podman containers
- Anything that doesn't work in containers or as a flatpak

## What is updating?

It means to click the `Update` button in **System Settings**.

![system-update](assets/img/system-update.png)

You can also run `sudo akshara update` in your terminal.

This should be done after editing [:material-file-star: `system.yaml`](reference/configs/system.md).

## Then how do I edit [`system.yaml`](reference/configs/system.md)?

Open your favorite text editor as root:

```sh
# GNOME
sudo gnome-text-editor /system.yaml

# KDE
sudo kate /system.yaml

# CLI editors
sudo nano /system.yaml

sudo micro /system.yaml
```

Make your edits, save, and update.

See [the reference](reference/configs/system.md) for details.

## I need to switch to X11!

!!! info "Only the {{ track("plasma") }} and {{ track("default-gnome") }}/{{ track("gnome") }} tracks use Wayland."

!!! warning "Android support will no longer work after switching."

First, install Xorg and update:

```yaml title="system.yaml"
packages:
  - xorg
```
<small>\* [`xorg`](https://archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/xorg/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } is a package *group*, not a standalone package.</small>

Then, change your session to X11 depending on your desktop's **login screen**:

### :material-gnome: GNOME (GDM)

There is a cog in the bottom right. Click it and choose `GNOME on Xorg`.

### :simple-kde: KDE (SDDM)

In the bottom left there is a session selector. Click it and choose `Plasma (X11)`.
