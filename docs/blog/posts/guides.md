You can now write [community guides](../../guides/README.md) for blendOS.
<!-- more -->

I wanted to be able to make a community wiki, but then I realized having a wiki *and* docs is dumb, and I don't want the docs to be on MediaWiki. However, `mkdocs` can be a wiki engine, so I've created a dedicated area for dedicated, personal guides.

There is no in-browser editing (minus the Gitlab web IDE), so it's not a wiki.

Feel free to try them out!
